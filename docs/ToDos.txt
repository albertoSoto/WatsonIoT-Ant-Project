Short Term:
1. Sometimes "ADAPTER_NOT_DETECTED" error shows up on Nexus 5, user might have to restart the app. Check with other devices.
2. Get rid of the Options Menu
3. Provide a check-box for each device in the listview to enable selection of multiple devices (One of each type, extension in long-term todos).
4. Add location information in transmission packet
5. If MQTT Publish failed, store the message to retry.
6. UI Update

Long Term:
1. Extend the services to be able to connect to multiple devices. Example â€“ heart rate monitor should be able to connect to multiple heart rate monitors
